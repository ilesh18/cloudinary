## Hackathon Track

### Track 1 — AI Media Pipelines

Submitted to **Track 1 — AI Media Pipelines** for the **Pixels to Products — Cloudinary AI Hackathon 2026**.

**Smart Media Content Factory** uses Cloudinary not as a passive file store, but as an active, programmatic media processing engine. Images uploaded to the platform undergo automated ingestion signal analysis, background removal, content-aware reframing, preset-driven derived transformations, responsive `f_auto,q_auto` delivery, and context-indexed search.

---

## The Problem vs. The Solution

### The Problem

Visual distribution across modern digital platforms is highly repetitive and time-consuming:

- A single photo must be manually re-cropped for Instagram Posts (1:1), Stories (9:16), YouTube (16:9), Web Banners (1920x600), and Profile Avatars.
- Naive center cropping accidentally cuts off critical focal subjects like faces, logos, or products.
- Removing backgrounds or maintaining disjointed asset folders wastes hours and storage quota.

### The Solution

**Upload once. Deliver everywhere.**

The platform ingests one high-resolution source file and instantly projects it into destination-specific variants across four core categories:

1. **SOCIAL**: Instagram Post, Instagram Portrait, Instagram Story / TikTok, YouTube Thumbnail, Social Square, Social Landscape.
2. **WEB**: Website Desktop Hero Banner, Website Mobile Banner.
3. **PERSONAL**: Profile Avatar / Thumbnail.
4. **COMMERCE**: Marketplace Square, Store Catalog, Product Thumbnail, Transparent Cutout PNG.

## Two-Branch Composition Architecture

Smart Media Content Factory intelligently branches its composition strategy based on media type:

```text
                       UPLOADED MASTER MEDIA
                                  │
                    CLOUDINARY INGESTION & ANALYSIS
                                  │
                 ┌────────────────┴────────────────┐
                 │                                 │
    PRODUCT / OBJECT MEDIA               GENERAL / LIFESTYLE PHOTO
                 │                                 │
   Cloudinary Background Removal        Cloudinary Content-Aware Crop
         (effect: 'background_removal')            (gravity: 'auto')
                 │                                 │
    Cutout Layered Composition           Preserved Focal Subjects
   (c_fit + c_lpad + b_rgb/white)       (f_auto, q_auto Reframing)
                 │                                 │
                 └────────────────┬────────────────┘
                                  ▼
                      PLATFORM-READY TARGET FORMAT
```

- **Product / Object Branch**: Extracts object cutouts with Cloudinary `effect: 'background_removal'` and composes them inside padded canvas boundaries (`c_fit` + `c_lpad`) to prevent subject clipping.
- **Lifestyle / Photography Branch**: Employs content-aware gravity (`gravity: 'auto'`) on the raw scene to intelligently reframe focal subjects without losing contextual backgrounds.

## Hackathon Verification Guide

Judges can verify Cloudinary integration directly inside the Cloudinary Dashboard.

1. **Uploaded media**: Check the Cloudinary Media Library for uploaded assets.
2. **Metadata and tags**: Inspect uploaded media for associated metadata, tags, and analysis results where available.
3. **Derived assets**: Inspect generated transformations and derived assets to verify that Cloudinary is performing the transformations.
4. **Search**: Verify that indexed metadata and generated assets can be searched through the application's Cloudinary Search integration.
5. **Delivery**: Open generated assets and inspect the Cloudinary delivery URLs and transformation parameters.

---

## Cloudinary Integration

Cloudinary is the core media engine of the application.

### Upload

Original media is uploaded through the Cloudinary Upload API using server-side processing.

### AI Analysis

Where enabled and available, the application uses Cloudinary's media analysis capabilities for information such as:

- AI-generated tags
- image quality signals
- color information
- watermark detection
- image/content classification
- other supported analysis metadata

Only results actually returned by Cloudinary are persisted and displayed.

### Background Removal

Cloudinary performs background removal on supported media.

The original image remains unchanged, while a processed representation can be used for product/object-focused compositions.

### Smart Cropping

Cloudinary intelligent/content-aware cropping is used for media formats where preserving the important subject is more useful than a basic center crop.

### Transformations

Destination-specific media variants are generated with Cloudinary transformations rather than client-side pixel manipulation.

Examples include:

- resizing
- cropping
- content-aware gravity
- product cutout composition
- padding
- layering
- background/underlay composition

### Optimized Delivery

Generated media uses Cloudinary optimized delivery where appropriate:

```text
f_auto
q_auto
```

This allows Cloudinary to select an appropriate delivery format and quality for the requesting device.

### Search

The application uses Cloudinary Search to find generated assets using indexed media information, tags, and associated metadata.

### Metadata

Firestore stores the application-level relationships between:

- users
- source media
- generated assets
- asset type
- platform
- processing state

Cloudinary remains responsible for the actual media.

```

---

## How It Works

### 1. Upload Once

The user uploads one master image.

### 2. Analyze

Cloudinary analyzes the uploaded media and returns available tags, visual signals, or other configured analysis information.

### 3. Choose the Destination

The user can generate formats for:

- Social
- Web
- Personal
- Commerce

### 4. Transform

Cloudinary generates the requested destination-specific variants.

### 5. Optimize

The generated content is delivered through optimized Cloudinary transformations.

### 6. Organize

Firestore stores the relationship between the user, source media, and generated assets.

### 7. Search and Reuse

The user can search, preview, download, regenerate, and share generated assets.

---

## Security & Data Isolation

- **Server-Side Credentials**: Cloudinary API secrets and Firebase Admin credentials remain server-side.
- **Token Verification**: Protected Express routes verify Firebase Authentication ID tokens.
- **Ownership Checks**: API operations verify that the authenticated user owns the requested media.
- **Firestore Rules**: Firestore security rules isolate private user data by authenticated UID.
- **No Secret Frontend Exposure**: Server-only credentials are never placed in `VITE_` frontend variables.

---

## Testing

### Basic Workflow

1. Create an account.
2. Log in.
3. Upload one image.
4. Confirm the upload succeeds.
5. Confirm Cloudinary receives the source media.
6. Confirm available AI/media analysis results appear.
7. Generate destination formats.
8. Open generated assets.
9. Search the media library.
10. Download an individual asset.
11. Download all available assets.
12. Generate a share link and open it.

### Media Types

Test the application with:

- Product images
- Portrait photographs
- Landscape photographs
- Event or general photographs

Verify that the composition strategy preserves the important visual subject for each type.

### Security

Verify that:

- Unauthenticated users cannot access protected application data.
- User A cannot access User B's private media.
- User A cannot regenerate User B's assets.
- User A cannot delete User B's products or media.
- Share links expose only intentionally shared content.

---

## Deployment

### Frontend

The frontend can be deployed to Vercel.

Recommended settings for a root-level Vite application:

```text
Framework Preset: Vite
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist
Install Command: npm install
```

Frontend environment variable:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-render-backend.onrender.com
```

### Backend

The Express backend can be deployed to Render.

Recommended settings when the backend lives inside `server/`:

```text
Root Directory: server
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: npm start
```

Required backend environment variables include:

```env
PORT=
CLIENT_ORIGIN=https://your-vercel-frontend.vercel.app

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=

FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=
```

Never place backend secrets in frontend environment variables.
